# X-SAMPA Alphabet

The list of symbols was taken from [https://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/sampa/x-sampa.htm](https://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/sampa/x-sampa.htm).
From the list ``symbols.json`` was created manually. Normalizations can be used to map phones that have multiple representations.
The hex number is the corresponding ipa symbol if available.

The script ``create_alphabet_file.py`` is used to convert it to the alphabet format.
